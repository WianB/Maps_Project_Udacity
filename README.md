# Maps_Project_Udacity

##An implementation of Knockout, Maps and Wikipedia

This is a project I created for Udacity combining the power of knockout to create a responsive Maps 
application showcasing some cool places to go and visit in Sydney. The application is loosely based on a MVC model.

JSON was used to store data related to the markers and the rest of the data is retrieved from the Google Maps API or Wikipedia API.

##Usage

Simply clone the repositry and click on the index.html file or visit the website through github pages on:
