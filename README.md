# Maps Project Udacity

## An implementation of Knockout, Maps and Wikipedia

This is a project I created for Udacity combining the power of knockout to create a responsive Maps
application showcasing some cool places to go and visit in Sydney. The application is loosely based on a MVC model.

JSON was used to store data related to the markers and the rest of the data is retrieved from the Google Maps API or Wikipedia API.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository** and click on the index.html, use a local webserver to host the files or visit the website through github pages on:

                        https://wianb.github.io/Maps_Project_Udacity/

** Wikipedia API has some security issues with github thus host the files locally to get the best experience
